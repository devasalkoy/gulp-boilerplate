# Gulp Vanilla Project Automation Boilerplate

To use this project, you'd need to have gulp and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) readily installed on your machine. You can do that if you don't already have gulp,
you can get it by running the command below

```js
npm install gulp-cli -g
```

Now that you already have gulp on your machine, navigate to your project directory where you have this repository and install the required
modules by running the command below

```js
npm install
```

Now you have your project automation setup, you can run the follow command run your project

```js
// to serve your project with auto reload
npm run serve

// to build your product for production
npm run build

// to compile just your HTML files
npm run compile-html

// to compile just your SCSS files
npm run compile-scss

// to compile just your image files
npm run compile-images

// to compile just your javascript files
npm run compile-javascript
```

Happy coding!!
